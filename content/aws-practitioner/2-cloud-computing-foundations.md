## Virtualization

Virtualization divides the hardware resources on a single physical server into smaller units called virtual machines. Each VM is its own server with its own OS, memory, storage, networking access. And that is at the heart of cloud computing.

VM usage is put on a meter, and that's how customers are built. There are two types of payment methods:
* **On demand**. (No long-term commitment or upfront payments)
* **Pay as you go**. (Pay by the hour or the second)
